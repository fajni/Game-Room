- Fetch Type = LAZY (On main page, you should get just PCs, not their Details. Same goes with Players),

- User can see pcs and details but not players, Manager can see everything but can delete or update, and
	Admin has CRUD operations.

- Cascading - to handle cascading saves ... but NOT deletes.
		- If you delete player, DO NOT delete pc,
		- If you delete pc, ALSO DELETE player.
